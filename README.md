# DH140_Week05 Final Work Idea


Nowadays, knowledge exchange between archival studies and other categories are common.
Quite a few techniques originated from other fields have been imported to cope with
questions in archival studies. The exchanging and adaptation process of imported techniques
can show us how innovative ideas and techniques from different areas can be adopted,
integrated, and ameliorated by scholars doing archival studies. Machine learning, which is
initially proposed by computer scientists, have been often adopted to resolve research
questions in archival studies, such as increasing the accessibility of archives, determining the
values of records, and building better digital curation tools. As a technique that has been only
introduced to this field recently but got widely used, tracing the adaption of machine learning
can open us a window to observe the diffusion of knowledge imported from other disciplines
in archival studies today.

This study is going to explore the whole process of researchers’ adaption of machine learning
in archival studies. It expects to understand how this happens within researchers and to their
broader community. Since the path and extent of knowledge flows are largely unobservable
in knowledge transfer, it has been generally assumed that bibliographic information and
citations of research articles can be used as a proxy to characterize and quantify knowledge
flows, which provide a theoretical base for empirical studies on knowledge diffusion .
Following the practice of previous research, the empirical analysis in this paper is based on
research articles that adopted or discussed on machine learning in archival studies. The author
is going to retrieve all the articles published on leading archival studies journals that list
“machine learning” in their keywords, and the author information, publication date and
citation information are extracted for analysis. Then both the citations between articles and
the connections between authors of those articles will be tracked to observe and model the
flow of researchers’ adaption of the machine learning technique in the field of archival
studies. The findings from this study can give us a better understanding of the knowledge
import process from other disciplines to archival studies, and the knowledge diffusion within
the field. It will provide some insights on promoting the diffusion of knowledge between
archival studies and other disciplines, as well as identifying some motivations and obstacles
to diffusing novel knowledge and innovations. Furthermore, the technique diffusion process
found in this study may also be transferable to broader social sciences, which will make
contributions to a larger academic society.

Data and viz of interest:

The data source should be citation data and metadata from scholarly journals, which can be accessed from Elsevier. I will use Elsevier API to access the data.
